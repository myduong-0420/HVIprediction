# Temperature rise simulation & HVI Prediction
---
This is the project done for USF ACM AI convention. We explore temperature rising pattern across the state of Florida using geospatial data on Google Earth and RobustLinearRegression. We then try to understand how these rising and lowering in temperatures affect US citizens by predicting the Heat Vulnerability index (HVI) using supervised and semi-supervised regressions with XGBoost and a simple feedforward ANN, and clustering.
